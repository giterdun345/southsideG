  <h3 align="center">Southside Paint & More</h3>
  <p align="center">
    Southside Paint + More is a painting company serving the Jacksonville area. Their original web page was slow and being in the top 15 painting companies in the area, needed a professional look. Furthermore the owner was paying $150/month for all the bells and whistles of dedicated hosting without requiring the extensive resources. I created an SEO friendly page, optimized for speed despite the image gallery and also added a job application form to add a database for potential employees, in addition to a contact database for clients. The image gallery uses Cloudinary and is linked with Facebook to make managing a breeze. The website is also ready for articles/blog/markdown portion, when they are ready, making it a full JAMstack. It saved almost 80% on cost and the owner was pleased with the outcome. Here is a demo version, that lives at Netlify.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
This is a website created for a small - medium sized business to improve their original page with responsiveness, performance, accessibility and SEO. The page features all of the services provided with links for soon to come articles aiding the SEO ranking. It has a gallery connected to Cloudinary which also linked to their business' Facebook. It allpws for easy management of work photos and takes only a few clicks to display the desired images. They are always looking for employees so I added an application form, through Netlify, which keeps the submitted forms and can be used as a database for potential employees. We spoke about implementing a blog and once they find a content writer, the blog and articles can be easily managed. I used Gatsby for the consideration of a future blog but mainly for image optimization. The plugins offer are great when it comes to performance. I was able to decrease the FCP by 2.4 seconds, decrease the overall cost by of the website 80% and improve their future ranking in search engines. I learned a lot about the JAM stack and how to utilize all of the Gatsby features. Server side rendering was a new concept but I would now consider Gatsby for all of my static sites after getting past the fundamentals of it.
